# Problem 1

## Load the penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Short description of the penguins dataset

The penguins dataset contains observational data, it includes 8
variables:

1.  species: The species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).
2.  island: The island where the penguins were observed (Torgersen,
    Biscoe, Dream).
3.  bill_length_mm: The length of the penguins’ bills in millimeters.
4.  bill_depth_mm: The depth of the penguins’ bills in millimeters.
5.  flipper_length_mm: The length of the penguins’ flippers in
    millimeters.
6.  body_mass_g: The mass of the penguins in grams.
7.  sex: The sex of the penguins (male, female).
8.  year: The year in which the penguin observations were recorded.

The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length across
all penguins in the dataset is 200.9152047 mm.

## Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Save the plot

``` r
ggsave("penguin_scatterpplot.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

## Create data frame

``` r
  p2_data=tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10,sd=1), 
  logic_vector = rnorm(10, sd = 1) > 0, 
  character_vector = c("aa","bb","cc","dd","ee","ff","gg","hh","ii","jj"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "low", "high", "medium", "low", "high", "medium", "low"))
  )
 
  view(p2_data)
```

## Means of each variable

``` r
mean_rs = mean(pull(p2_data, random_sample))
mean_lv = mean(pull(p2_data, logic_vector))
mean_cv = mean(pull(p2_data, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_data, character_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_fv = mean(pull(p2_data, factor_vector)) 
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_data, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

The mean of character vector and factor vector cannot be obtained
because they are non-numeric and cannot be averaged.

## Covert to numeric

``` r
numeric_lv = as.numeric(pull(p2_data, logic_vector))
numeric_cv = as.numeric(pull(p2_data, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
numeric_fv = as.numeric(pull(p2_data, factor_vector))
```

- Logic to numeric conversion works because logical values are treated
  as 1 (TRUE) and 0 (FALSE).
- Character to numeric conversion does not work because there’s no
  numeric equivalent for character values, the value turns to NA.
- Factor to numeric conversion works because factor has underlying
  numeric codes.
